# What are RegEx?

## RegEx: Are short form of "Regular Expressions"

>> A regular expression, regex or regexp[1] (sometimes called a rational expression)[2][3] is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings.

# 3 Motivating Example

## Places where I've used RegEx extensively

### 1. Validation Rules {E.g. Emails, Phone, Addresses}
### 2. Scraping {E.g. Extracting Prices, Text Snippets etc}
### 3. Translation {E.g. Replacing a piece of text with another}
### 4. Parsing Logs {E.g. Parsing Apache and Nginx logs}

# RegEx Grammar {Part 1}

RegEx has a grammar, one tool that I have found useful is [RegEx101](https://regex101.com/).
This tool allows us to quickly iterate over our regex and see how it works.

Few things to keep in mind:

1. There are **more than one way** to write same regex
1. RegEx are **greedy** by default {That means it tries to extract as much as possible until it conforms to a pattern even when a smaller part would have been syntactically sufficient.}
1. When writing RegEx try to make sure we've tested both Positive **and** Negative test cases
1. RegEx are **language neutral** i.e. it works **ALL** languages {including JS, PHP etc}

Bonus: [RegEx Cheat Sheet](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html) comes in handy, don't try and cram stuff into your Memory

# RegEx Grammar {Part 1}

### Characters

1. **`\d`**: Digits {0-9}
1. **`\w`**: Word character this includes Alphabets {Case Insensitive}, Digits and Underscore
1. **`\s`**: White spaces {including tabs, new line and character returns}

Note: Capital of above character match inverses. E.g. '\D' will match anything that is not a digit

### Quantifiers

1. **`.`**: Matches occurance of any character
1. **`?`**: Optional Match
1. **`+`**: Match atleast one
1. **`{x}`**: Matches occurances of expression **Exactly x** number of times
1. **`{x, y}`**: Matches occurances of expression **Range x, y** number of times
---

# RegEx Grammar {Part 1} Examples

Some examples:

1. Match names Fafadia Group and Fafadia Tech
1. Match Indian Mobile Numbers
1. Match India Mobile Numbers including Land Line Numbers
1. Match all tags containing tags {E.g. a, p, h1, h2, h3 etc}

---

# RegEx Grammar {Part 2}

### Logic

1. **`|`**: Matches sub-expressions within the group
1. **`(...)`**: Encapsulate sub-expressions in a group
1. **`^`**: If used at starting of an expression it means "at the start"
1. **`^`**: If used in a group it negates

### Class Characters

1. **`[]`**: Matches any of the character
1. **`[a-z]`**: Ranges of characters between a and z

---

# RegEx Grammar {Part 2} Examples

Some examples:

1. Match "Peach, Punch and Pinch"
1. Match IP Addresses
1. Match Email Addresses
1. Match Domains

# RegEx in Python {findall}

```python
import re

text_snippet = "there was a PEACH who PINCH, in return punch were flying around"

# re.compile compiles regex into an objects
# this makes it easier to work with regex
# re.IGNORECASE is a flag, you can have multiple such flags
pch_regex = re.compile(r"p.{1,3}ch", re.IGNORECASE)

for current_match in pch_regex.findall(text_snippet):
    print current_match
```
---

# RegEx in Python {search}

```python
import re

def validate_email(current_email):
    """
    check if email is valid
    """
    email_re = re.compile(r"\w+\@\w+\.(com|co\.in)", re.IGNORECASE)
    # .search() method is used to TEST if regex matches at all
    return email_re.search(current_email) is not None

print validate_email("iamsidd@gmail.com")
print validate_email("iamsidd@.co")
```
---

# RegEx in Python {finditer}

```python
import re

text_snippet = "there was a PEACH who PINCH, in return punch were flying around"
pch_regex = re.compile(r"p.{1,3}ch", re.IGNORECASE)

for current_match in pch_regex.finditer(text_snippet):
    print "Starts at:%d, Ends at:%d" % (current_match.start(), current_match.end())
```
---

# RegEx in Python {re.sub}

```python
import re

text_snippet = "there was a PEACH who PINCH, in return punch were flying around"
pch_regex = re.compile(r"p.{1,3}ch", re.IGNORECASE)
text_snippet_translated = re.sub(pch_regex, "_", text_snippet)
print text_snippet_translated
```
